# Regression_Techniques
Numerous regression techniques applied to make future predictions based on the existing data.

# Regression_Analysis
The regression_analysis.ipynb analyses the dataset by plotting it and making comparisons between curves. The dataset used is a single column containing data of increasing number of people infected by the novel coronavirus-19 on a daily basis both in and out of China.

# Linear_Regression
The Linear_Regression.ipynb applies multiple linear regression techniques to examine which would be the best technique that would be applied.

# Support_Vector_Regression
The Support_Vector_Regression.ipynb applies the Support Vector Machine but for regression instead of classification. It deals with different problems like why scaling the data is important.

# Neural_Network_Regression
The Neural_Network_Regression.ipynb applies a basic Neural Network for regression to predict future values and also covers the respective problems found.

# Statistical_Models_Regression
The Statistical_Models_Regression.ipynb applies many different statistical and forecasting models to clean the data starting from simple average techniques and going up to the ARIMA model.
